# Key Insights from IT Support Analysis Dashboard

## Performance Metrics
- **SLA Adherence**: Only 61.66% of tickets are meeting service level agreements, indicating significant room for improvement in response times.
- **Average Resolution Time**: 3 days across all tickets, with high priority tickets resolved faster (approximately 1.5 days) than low priority tickets (nearly 4 days).
- **Ticket Volume**: 11,923 total tickets with an average of 23.06 tickets per day, suggesting a high support workload.

## Ticket Trends and Distribution
- **Priority Distribution**: "High" is the most common priority level, potentially indicating either critical system issues or priority inflation.
- **Ticket Type**: "Change" requests dominate the ticket types, suggesting significant system modifications or updates are occurring.
- **Declining Ticket Volume**: The "Tickets Raised By Year" chart shows a clear downward trend from 2,432 in early 2024 to 1,401 projected by early 2025, which could indicate improving system stability.

## Support Categories
- **Primary Tags**: Technical issues (3,057) represent the largest category, followed by Security (2,033) and Bug reports (1,253), highlighting areas requiring most attention.
- **Support Queue Distribution**: Technical Support (2,232) and Product Support (1,391) handle the majority of tickets, suggesting these areas may need additional resources.

## Geographic Distribution
- **Country Distribution**: Support tickets are concentrated in Central European countries, with notable volumes in France, Spain, Italy, Austria, Sweden, and the Netherlands.

## Operational Insights
- **Priority Trend**: All priority levels show a declining trend since July, with the most significant drop occurring between June and August.
- **Resolution Efficiency**: There's a clear correlation between priority and resolution time, with high priority tickets resolved approximately 2.5 times faster than low priority ones.

## Recommendations
1. Improve SLA adherence by addressing bottlenecks in the resolution process, particularly for medium and low priority tickets.
2. Investigate the high volume of change requests to determine if process improvements could reduce these tickets.
3. Allocate additional resources to Technical and Product Support teams to manage their higher ticket volumes.
4. Consider specialized training for technical issues as they represent the largest category of support requests.
5. Evaluate the geographic distribution of support staff to ensure adequate coverage for high-volume regions in Europe.
